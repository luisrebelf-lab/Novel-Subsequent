History	
	</h1>
<p>
	The Arledge family was always very distant from one another, when Trix was "born" no one really wanted to take on the responsibility. Chet's wife at the time was interested in having children, so Chet took in Trix. After the divorce 4 years later, Chet was left with a kid he didn't really want. He focused more on his love life, and thus tried to distract Trix by giving them early, unrestricted, access to the internet; this would have severe repercussions.

Description	
	</h1>
<p>
	Raised on the computer Trix has been exposed to every awful end of the internet, and through this has gained a sense of superiority over anyone she sees as less informed or more gullible than herself. She views herself as an awesome sociopath manipulator, who only sees people as objects that will be thrown away if they don't serve their purpose. She's an anime loving shut in who spends most of her time indoors. Her brain has been poisoned by what looked cool in her favorite anime. The most interaction she receives irl is with the various marionettes and mannequins she keeps in her room and controls with a large set up of strings.
