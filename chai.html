History	
	</h1>
<p>
	Dropped from a meteor straight into the shores of Corpus Christi, A granny found her about 10 minutes later, when the meteor had floated away-leaving the baby with a small, unassuming pen on May 14th, 2009. SHE raised the baby, naming them Chai. Their life was pretty normal after that, moved to Fort Worth at 3, raised by cousins and other family in a hot potato group effort, and given a laptop in 2013. Shenanigans ensue.

Description	
	</h1>
<p>
	Rambunctious little girl. Vietnamese in origin. Though it also means Tea, Chai is named for the first thing her adoptive grandmother said upon seeing her- "trời ơi!!" At least, that's how the story goes. She watches anime, makes art, just about everything under the sun! She'll never stop to pause, because god forbid her life be boring, right?
