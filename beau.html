History
	</h1>
	<p>
The Berkel family is known across the valley as a force of nature angrier than a mutant honey badger. That's how they got the land they live on actually, scaring the other townsfolk shitless so they just gave the entire valley bottom to them. They use it to farm mostly, but they haven't been doing the best at it ever since the great fire that consumed the farmstead. Flames so tall they could be seen over the mountains surrounding the valley. They say that one of the Berkels was inside the field when the fire started. But that couldn't be the case. They'd be dead for sure, right?

Description
	</h1>
<p>
	Beau is angry, like the rest of his family, but he has learned to temper his anger through the art of cooking. This lets his more positive personality traits shine through, like his generosity and creativity. Unfortunately he is constantly kneecaped by his need for perfection, never letting something rest until it gets his personal seal of approval. Something that is constantly getting harder to achieve
