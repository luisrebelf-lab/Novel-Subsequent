	It is April 4th of 2020. Everything is going well, but a few months ago you've been forced to stay inside of your house as there is a WORLD WIDE PANDEMIC. You and some friends decide to play a new popular game called SBURB:BETA with the promise of going on fun ADVENTURES and making new friends! Surely nothing bad can happen.. right?
